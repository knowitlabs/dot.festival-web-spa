      <h1 class="dot">Conference Code of Conduct</h1>

      <p class="dot">
        All attendees, speakers and organisers at our conference are required to
        agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this
        code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants
        to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        Contact anyone in the conference staff (look for staff badge) or use the
        slack channel.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dot">The Quick Version</h2>

      <p class="dot">
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
        experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
        expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
        body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        We encourage inclusive language in conference talks. A good starting
        point towards inclusive language is to avoid default-gendered words like
        "guys"/"gals"/"him"/"her" when talking generally about a group of
        people. A tip is to try out words like "people"/"everyone" or "the
        team"/"the developers".
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
        Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
        including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.
        Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
        expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the
        conference organisers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="dot">The Less Quick Version</h2>

      <p class="dot">
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
        identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
        appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
        sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
        talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
        sexual attention.
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
        organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
        the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
        immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they will be wearing
        branded clothing and/or badges.
      </p>

      <p class="dot">
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
        those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
        conference. We value your attendance.
