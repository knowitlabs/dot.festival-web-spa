This document serves two purposes; firstly, to explain what **`dot.festival`** is and secondly to describe how the conference is planned and executed from the beginning to the end.

This document should be perceived as an internal asset and is aimed towards the people involved in planning **`dot.festival`**.

If mentioned without context, the term participant used throughout the document describes people participating in the conference, even speakers.

Processes change, previously obvious things come into new perspectives, and therefore it is important that this document is kept alive and relevant.

Update the document so carefully that after reading it through, you should be able to organize **`dot.festival`** without prior knowledge.

## What is **`dot.festival`**?

**`dot.festival`** is the Knowit’s internal conference. We arrange and plan it, we are its speakers and we make up for its audience. In short, it is organized for us, by us

The ambition is for **`dot.festival`** to be held annually along with hosting it in various locations. The conferences usually begins on a Friday during midday and proceeds until Saturday evening. But this can change from year to year.

## Committee and roles

### Committee members

The conference committee consists of individuals from different Knowit-companies. There are no rules that decide who is allowed to join the committee; new members are always welcome to engage! You are expected to be engaged and to be driven to create a conference you would like to attend yourself.

No one in the committee is pointed out to be responsible, although it usually occurs that those working with arrangements regarding the conference facility/hotels play a significant role in the planning since it is one of the most crucial parts of **`dot.festival`**.

In the initial planning stage of the upcoming **`dot.festival`**, it is a huge benefit to be a larger group, preferably around 10 people. Earlier experience has shown cases of members not having time to engage, and people quitting Knowit.

### Trainees and volunteers

Sometimes we can get help and assistance from trainees or volunteers during the days of the conference. What is expected of them is help with placing out posters, t-shirts, nametags etc. as well as tidying up when the conference has ended. Occasionally, they can be responsible for watching over the sessions and they must be ready to assist if there are any technical difficulties.

### Graphic designer

A role that can support with the graphical elements of the conference is also needed. People with this role are usually responsible for keeping the direct contact with printworks for stickers, t-shirts etc.

### Administration

If possible, it could be efficient to get help regarding generic administrative questions, nonetheless the dialog with our conference facility.

### Supporter and financial manager

The main manager for **`dot.festival`**, its supporter if you will. This person is usually the individual responsible for the Knowit Solutions business area.

These are some of the risks to consider by committing to take on the role as supporter:

- If something unpredictable would happen that leads to the charge per person being greater than what was promised in communication, it must be handled in an appropriate way.
- It may happen that we must cancel the conference due to too few participants. This might result in fees charged by the hotel/conference facility.
- Being a sponsor also involves responsibility to synchronize with our other business areas.

### Contract manager

The committee will receive help with negotiating hotel prices if needed. Knowit has established relations with hotels and in some cases, we might get discounts.

#### Recurring meetings

Recurring meetings plays a vital role in the work around planning the conference. They are usually held every other week. Every meeting has an agenda and is concluded with a member taking the responsibility of booking the next meeting (if a meeting series is not set up).

Meeting notes are usually shared in Slack along with references to people responsible for tasks that were born out of the meeting. The tasks are also added to Trello.

#### Time reporting

The time you put into working in the committee must be discussed with your closest manager. There is no shared UBW-code for arranging **`dot.festival`**. Different companies in our concern have different policies regarding this type of initiative.

#### Budget

When the budget is calculated we base it on there being at least 100 participants. That means the fee covers the conference expenses exactly. The lists below are parts we normally include in the budget. Besides the hotel costs, the only other requirement is name badges. The rest can be disregarded if the costs soar away. The summation is made excluding VAT (Value Added Tax). We usually create a budget for both 100 and 120 participants to create an understanding of how it can turn out.

Calculate the individual costs and divide them by 100 and 120, respectively. The charge per participant that is formed should have an added margin towards additional costs.

##### Venue and hotels

1. Conference rooms
2. Coffees, lunches, snacks
3. Hotel rooms
4. Hotel dinner (alternatively at separate restaurants, but that decision is made later)
5. Other accessories like extra microphones and furniture.

##### Printing and profile products

1. T-shirt
2. Name tag
3. Drink-ticket
4. Decal

##### Shooting

1. Creative Crew
   1. Equipment cost
   2. Eventual staff cost

## Country and city

There are a few parts to consider when choosing a city for the conference.

1. If possible, it is preferred to vary between cities where **`dot.festival`** is hosted each year.
2. There must be a larger Knowit-office in the host city, where there are many presumptive participants and speakers.
3. At least two committee members must be situated in the local Knowit-office.

### Dates

Historically, the committee has aimed towards holding the conference in November, alternatively in late January. Here are some points to contemplate when the date is decided:

1. Are there any other internal Knowit-conferences that are held simultaneously? It can be on company level or collective ones. ([Testit](https://www.knowit.se/tjanster/solutions/systemutveckling-och-forvaltning/test-och-kvalitetssakring/konferens-testit/), [Kravdagen](https://info.knowit.se/kravdagen) etc.).
2. Are there any other external tech conferences on the same dates that we know many Knowit-employees will want to attend?
3. Are there any holidays (like winter holiday) simultaneously?
4. Are there any national days or other city events that could cause complications?

Plan **`dot.festival`** two weeks before or after larger events. It has appeared that people with families become less motivated to attend an event like this when it is planned close upon another one.

It could be good to decide on 2–3 alternative dates that can be included in the quotation request for the hotel.

## Hotel and conference facility

The factors weighed into choosing a facility are their supply of hotel rooms, quality of conference facility, geographical location, and price.

Hotel rooms for one night are included in the charge and are only allowed for the participants that must travel. If the participant wishes to extend their stay at the hotel, they generally can, supposing they pay for the extra charges that implies.

By default, a participant shares a hotel room with a colleague. This is a way to encourage social interaction and makes the conference less costly. It is possible for the participant to choose a single room at an additional cost. That additional cost is debited beyond the charge per participant and is added to the invoice sent to the company where the participant works.

### Geographical location

- The facility should be close to a central station for trains and have good commuting options to/from flights. Generally, Knowit recommends travelling restrictively and preferably by train.
- We try to avoid extra trips from the central station to the conference facility.

### Quotation request

When making quotation requests to conference facilities they should contain the information below. Some are parts we fill in ourselves, and others are where we need answers:

#### Date

See header "Date" above.

#### Times

From Friday midday until Saturday evening, with possibilities for pre- and post-arrangements by organizers. The committee members will have to be there between 8:00 am and 9:00 am to arrange equipment, sort nametags etc.

#### VAT

All prices must be excluding VAT.

#### Number of participants

An estimation with the help of the number of participants in the years prior. Most recent years there have been around 120 attendees.

#### Conference rooms

A larger room where everyone can fit in and three more that holds room for 30-50 in so-called auditorium seating. The quotation request should contain information about the number of seats for both auditorium and school seating. Also, it must be possible to add tables if workshops are held. The rooms need to be near each other, so that there is enough time to switch between them during 10-minute breaks.

#### Lunches

Lunch must be included during Friday and Saturday. It should be warm and there should be options for people with alternating diets (vegetarian, vegan, allergies etc.). A list of people with special diets must be compiled and given to the hotel.

#### Lunch serving

How are the lunches served? Is it in connection to the conference rooms? Do we sit or stand to eat? Earlier it has shown that it is best to stand since we stay seated throughout the majority of **`dot.festival`**. It also makes it easier to socialize.

#### Dinner

We strive to have dinner outside of the conference facility on Friday evening. But as a back-up if we fail to plan the dinners, we make a quotation request including dinner at the hotel as well. There can be varieties of beverage- and dinner-packages. The offers that are given by the hotel will be a foundation in creating a budget and later the charge per participant at the conference.

#### Fika

Coffee and tea need to be available as well as snacks and appetizers during longer breaks.

#### Hotel rooms

Price for both single- and double rooms. It important to clarify that it should be possible to pull the beds apart in the double-rooms.

#### Cancellation

The conference should be able to be cancelled one month before the event, since that is when the committee can establish if there will be enough participants to carry the conference through. The standard for most hotels is to disable the free cancellation-period three months prior to the event. In other words, that needs to be negotiated.

During the last month, hotels usually have a form of price ladder where it is allowed to adjust X% of the participant amount, free of charge. That subject must be clear in the quotation response.

#### Microphones

Are microphones included in all conference rooms? If not, how much does it cost to add one?

#### Standing pulpit/standing table

Are there standing pulpits in each conference room? It will be needed for when there are two speakers.

#### Internet

Internet access during the whole conference is crucial and needs to be ensured. Some hotels offer an extended network, but that is usually not necessary.

#### Validity for quotation

Usually, the validity of a quotation is set to one month. It might be wise to ask for a longer validity period.

#### Company contact information

See Invoice recipient.

#### Extended stay

Some participants might want to extend their stay at the hotel. Can we let the hotel take complete responsibility for those participants and can they offer a discount? I.e., can they arrange a private invoice for the extended stay?

### Other hotel information

Here is a list of questions that do not necessarily have to be answered in a quotation. It would be splendid to discuss these when visiting the hotel for viewing.

#### Check- in

What time do the attendees check-in on Friday? Can we do it in a group?

#### Check-out

What time do we have to check out on Saturday?

#### Luggage storage

Is it possible to store luggage in a room before check-in and after check-out?

#### Key cards

The conference rooms need to be possible to look between Friday evening and Saturday morning. Can it be arranged so that many of those arranging the conference can unlock these rooms?

#### Interior

If there are images of the conference rooms, they are of interest.

#### Floor plan

A floor plan where emergency exits are marked is good to have. Particularly at a later stage.

#### Connection to projectors

What technics do the hotels have in regards of projectors?

#### Power outlets

Is there access to power outlets in each room, so that participants can charge computers and phones during keynotes?

#### Other activities at the hotel

Will other companies host a conference in the same facility during the same dates? Or are there other activities at, or around the hotel?

### Choosing conference facility

After quotations are gathered it can be useful to create a visual image of how the different hotels have priced the various parts. There must be a few hypothetical estimations since the number of participants and how many of them will need a hotel room is unknown.

As a hint in the quotation request, we state that we can be around 120 participants of which around 70 will need a hotel room. The limit we set so that the budget can go together is 100 participants.

The following four parts are separated in the compilation:

- Conference facility
- Coffee, lunches, snacks
- Hotel rooms
- Dinner at the hotel (that possibly won't take place)

In the summation above, columns marked in red are the highest prices, and those in green the lowest.

This estimation serves as a foundation to which facilities should be prioritized to visit. Always visit the facility before the decision is made – apart from all data collection, the gut-feeling is also included in making the choice.

To clarify, we make our own budget. In other words, if the costs end up at 600 000 SEK, we need to ensure that the participation fee covers the costs. Of course, we can not have a too high participation fee. It needs to sync with top management if prices rise too sharply. In addition, we do not want to scare away potential participants because it will be too costly. The fee for the conference in 2021 was 3900 SEK, the highest so far.

When the contract with the hotel is signed, there will be a rather calm period. There might be a question occasionally regarding changing furniture etc.

**Keep track of last day to cancel**

It is crucial to keep track of the last day to cancel the entire conference with no additional fees. If there are too few participants that registered to the event in comparison with the participant amount in the set budget, and the date is around the corner, discuss with the supporter/main manager to get instructions on what to do and to decide the next step.

**The days following up to the conference**

The days following up to the conference become increasingly intense. Here are things that usually are communicated. Some only once, others more as a reoccurring status-check:

1. Total number of participants.
2. Number of single-bed rooms respectively double-bed rooms.
3. People that want to extend their stay, and how they want to do it. I.e., if they want to arrive before the conference or stay for longer. Or both.
4. If anyone wants to bring family members.
5. The hotel will need the conference program to be able to plan for fika-breaks and lunches.
6. It needs to be communicated if the dinner on Friday will be happen.
7. How do you communicate with the hotel as a guest? E-mail address, phone number, contact person and is a reference number/booking number needed?
8. Table where name tags, t-shirts etc. can be placed
9. Some hotels have a display close to the reception/entrance where they show what is happening at the hotel. This information needs to be synced with the hotel, i.e., text, logo, and other graphical components.
10. If drink-tickets will be used before the dinner it needs to be synced with the hotel. What do they look like and what drinks can they be exchanged with?

## The dinner

The Friday evening dinner is one of the most appreciated **`dot.festival`**-activities. Historically it has been done in two ways; either as a common dinner at the conference facility, or with people divided into smaller groups at different restaurants.

### At different restaurants

A few years ago, there was a Knowit-CEO-meeting in Oslo. Instead of concluding the night with a common dinner for everyone, smaller groups went out to different restaurants in the city. This turned out to be a very appreciated way of spending time and getting to know each other. Us in the committee liked this idea and since then the same concept has been used for **`dot.festival`**.

### What makes it so appreciated is that it is more intimate, and you get to know some colleagues better. Furthermore, you get the opportunity to see the city you are in, a bit more.

### Here are some things to consider and prepare for:

1. Set a budget for what food and drinks should cost per person. This is done in relation to the planning of the main budget.
2. The groups must be around 8 people
3. Look for restaurants near the venue with a 20-minute walking distance at most.
4. The restaurants should have a good reputation and be above average. They should also be similar to each other.
5. Look up if the restaurants have the possibility to send us invoices. It is not crucial but makes the logistics easier.
6. Find out if the restaurant requires pre-booking meals. (Sometimes pre-booking might be mandatory if the group contains 8 people.)
7. If the restaurant selections are limited and/or there are many conference-participants, the group could be divided into two and go to larger restaurants.
8. Book the restaurant and be meticulous about noting the last reservation cancellation date.
9. Groups

The handling of groups is complicated and requires a tool like excel to be manageable

1. If there are minorities, place them into groups in pairs. Then there will be more security for them, and they can back each other up when speaking in the groups. For example, if there are only two participants from Poland it is recommended that they are placed in the same dinner group.
2. Strive after having at least two women in a group and not having only one woman in a group (we have received feedback about this before).
3. Choose one person that is familiar with the city/area to be responsible for the dinner group. This is synched in advance.
4. Determine who can pay the bill if the restaurant does not allow invoicing. It does not necessarily have to be the person responsible for the dinner group.
5. Take the participants diet-preference and allergies into consideration. Don’t place a seafood-allergic person in a popular seafood-restaurant.
6. After taking all the points above into consideration, it would be nice if it is possible to make sure that the groups are well mixed - with people from different countries and different companies.

**At the conference facility**

The advantage of planning the dinner at the hotel is that it requires minimal administration from the committee.

Here are some things to consider and to prepare for:

1. Decide on the food- and drink menu the hotel recommends.
2. Find out how the tables are set up - with the number of seats and number of tables, if the tables are round or squared and the layout of the tables. If we are around 150 participants, we will need around 19 tables if we want people to sit together.
3. Put together mixed groups – different countries, cities and knowit companies.
4. Make table place cards and eventually bigger table placement blueprints that everyone can look at.

## Design and theme

We try to find a graphic designer early on in the planning process. It is ideal if the designer comes from the same city as the hosting city, and if they can be involved in the committee in its initial stages. If possible, we try to find a theme that can be related/tied to the city/country the conference is held in. However, the design could practically be anything as long as it is adapted to developers (see [geeky](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Geeky)), and that we follow our own [brand book](https://www.knowit.se/brandbook/introduction/).

## Merchandise and profile products

Posters and name tags are examples of things we must have at the conference. There are also other promotional items that encourages acknowledging **`dot.festival`** and Knowit.

## Here is a list of items that are relevant:

### T-Shirt

If the first **`dot.festival`** is disregarded, we have always had a new T-shirt at each conference. We exclude the year on the T-shirt, so it will not feel outdated after a year (However, nothing says that we _must_ have a T-shirt).

### Signs

There are many different t-shirts (XXS to XXXL in female and male models), therefore we put up signs that make it easier to choose the correct one.

### Name tags

Name tags are needed so that we can see who belongs to the conference. But mainly to make it easier to mingle. The name tags include the following:

- First name and last name
- Knowit company (complete with AB, AS etc.).
- Country visualized with a flag

Some conference year the tag was laminated, but usually it is placed in a plastic pocket/folder that can be used multiple times. We also use plastic pockets with two hooks attached on each side. This prevents the name tags from turning to the wrong side. These plastic pockets have also been used to hold stickers and drink-tickets.

If there is only one hole in the plastic pocket, for one hook, the listed information must be printed on both sides.

### Drink-ticket

Many years we have had drink-tickets that we create ourselves. They are usually worth around 100 SEK/NOK and can be traded for an optional drink at the hotel or alternatively at a club.

### Conference boxes

We have had cardboard boxes for some years with different logos and messages. They are commonly easy to pack and if they have Velcro straps different prints can be added to them each year.

### Decals

If there is budget for it, we create decals that for example could be stuck to computers. These decals normally contain the conference name, city, and year.

### Coffee mugs

2021 was the first time we made coffee mugs with logo prints.

### Role-ups and posters

Normally, Knowit’s PR-department lets us borrow display products. They must be booked in time. However, this depends on how much material the local Knowit office already has.

## Mail dispatching

Sending emails is an important part of the conference. Two of our mails are dispatched to a greater part of Knowit and this is the PR-departments responsibility. Here it is important to ensure that is reaches at least three of four business areas, but preferably to the entire Knowit group at the same time.

> **There is no such thing as being too clear when communicating with our participants. Be conscious about that they are from different countries, have different native languages and that they work at different knowit offices. In some cases, the culture differs a lot. Do not overlook anything and be as clear as possible.**

List of emails, in the order they are sent:

### Call for Presentations

The first email we send is mostly aimed towards speakers, but it also works as a reminder for people to add **`dot.festival`** to their calendars. This is sent to the business areas Solutions, Experience and Connectivity. For the conference in 2023 it was even sent to Insight, and we wish to keep it this way.

[sample cfp email]

### Call for presentations reminder

If there are not enough applications for sessions, we send out a reminder two weeks before the application deadline.

### Your talk has been accepted

Our goal is to send answers to CfP’s as soon as the program is set. We strive towards accepting at least one presentation per speaker.
[sample cfp acceptance email]

### Welcome to the &lt;conference&gt;! Register now!

If we have enough sessions for two days and have sent acceptation confirmations for them, it is time to send out information about participation registration, and that to as many business areas as possible

[sample]

### Registration Confirmation

This email confirms registration and is sent out to everyone, speakers included. The goal is both to inform in general and to make it clear that cancelling is not possible from here on out.

[sample]

### Hotel accommodation

The purpose of this dispatch is to inform about the accommodation including their contact information. Namely if a participant has a single room or a double room. If they have a double room, it should be conveyed who the room is shared with.

[sample]

### Speaker information

Information about what you should/could think about as a speaker. Sent two weeks before the conference.

[sample]

### Just-in-time-info

Some week before the conference we send out an email to all participants and speakers. One part will be repetition of information that has already been sent out and the other part is information that has been added, if any.

[sample]

### Conference dinner

This information is sent when we have booked different restaurants for the dinner on Friday. Meaning if we will not have dinner at the hotel. The dispatch contains information about the restaurant name, times, address, and the person responsible for the dinner group. The responsible should be from the city.

Another email is sent to the responsible person that clarifies if the restaurant will send an invoice or if someone in the group should pay with their credit or debit card.

[sample]

### Evaluation

The committee wants feedback to make a better conference next time. The purpose of this dispatch is just that and points to a form that a participant/speaker fills in.

[sample]

## Monitoring **`dot.festival`** (social media etc.)

_[Placeholder]_

**Creative Crew**

Creative Crew is a group from Knowit Experience Bergen and Knowit Objectnet in Oslo whose mission is to record conferences, internal company presentations and more. They also possess knowledge and material to enables them to send live. We never go out with information about that filming will take place before **`dot.festival`**. The reason for that is primarily to attract people to attend the conference physically.

CC have been present when Norway has hosted **`dot.festival`**, and those costs were covered by Experience and/or Objectnet. Shipping the filming equipment to Sweden was not a part of our budget until the conference held in Scandic Continental 2021. The committee budgeted the filming to 30000 SEK, this excluded the cost for the staff. Later we decided that the surplus of our budget would go to the staff involved.

## Tools and services

The tools and services we have used for **`dot.festival`** has varied throughout the years. Their common requirement has been that they should be free to use.

## The following are tools we have used recently:

We have tried using both EPiServer and [https://konferanse.knowit.no](https://konferanse.knowit.no) earlier, but it has not really been for us.

## Website

We use our website for general information but mainly to show the program. The web has historically been one of the tasks that has taken a lot of time to maintain. This is partly because the tools have been of varying quality and partly because information periodically has changed a lot.

## Invoice recipient

The company that is on the receiving end of the supplier invoices can vary. When the conference has been held in Sweden/Stockholm the parent company (Knowit AB) has taken responsibility for it. When **`dot.festival`** has taken place in Norway, Knowit subsidiaries have taken care of re-invoicing and other things.

This discussion must be made before contracts are signed and purchases are made.

## Participant invoicing

Normally, invoicing of the participant fee is handled by the Knowit company that also has the contract with the hotel- and conference facility. This means that it is handled by the company that external suppliers send invoices to (this can be photos, printing for merch, restaurants, etc).

The handling of supplier invoices should be discussed in an early stage of planning **`dot.festival`**. To clarify, decide on a Knowit company that is the recipient of the invoices and that handles the economy.

Await all supplier invoices before the forwarding of them begins. It is not uncommon that surprises occur. There have been cases when a participant has forgotten to pay for an extended stay, a drink in the mini bar and more. It can also occur that the shipping cost of transported goods was higher than what has been predicted and discussed.

If there is a surplus, gather the committee and discuss the option to lower the participant fee for all attendees. When the parent company (Knowit AB) has handled the invoicing, we have been able to save the surplus to the upcoming **`dot.festival`**. It is unknown if this is possible when a child company handles the invoicing. Anyhow, it is not our intention to make money off **`dot.festival`** – that is not its purpose.

Should there be a deficit in the budget, discuss with the person that is the most responsible for **`dot.festival`** how to go about it further.

The committee compiles the invoicing data. It should consist of the following:

- First and last name of the participants
- The complete Knowit company name (including company suffix like AB, AS etc...)
- The Knowit company’s country and city
- The sum of what the participant should pay, excluding VAT.

We need around 45 to create a program that can fill two days.We can take help from the PR-department to send out a reminder email, but first we can try per company. We also talk about it in company meetings, in shared chats etc.                                                                                                                                  | Members                                               |
| 11         | IRL-meeting to set the program and accept the presentations.                         | A much-appreciated activity where we meet and set the program together. The meeting is held at the Knowit office in the city where **`dot.festival`** is hosted.The rule is that at least one presentation per speaker should be approved. If two presentations are too similar, both speakers can be contacted to check if they can agree on one presentation or divide the subject.                                                                  | Members                                               |
| 12         | Compile and dispatch “Your talk has been accepted”                                   | The mails dispatched are tailored for each speaker.Here you can program your way to a solution and use google sheets directly. Alternatively, the necessary data to compose each mail can be exported.Important to bcc [dot.festival@knowit.eu](mailto:dot.festival@knowit.eu), since some speakers later will search for this mail (and might even claim that they have not received it). In these cases, it is good that anyone can resend it.       | Members                                               |

| 14         | Publish program at [https://dot.knowit.eu](https://dot.knowit.eu)                    | Usually takes some time to do this, so you can send out “Welcome to the &lt;conference&gt;! Register now!“ before the program is on the web.But it is a great benefit to have the program done before dispatching the application form since they can decide if they want to go based on the program content.                                                                                                                                          | Members                                               |

## History

The idea of holding a conference “by developers, for developers” arose sometime in August 2012 within Knowit Objectnet in Norway. It was important that the conference’s title make clear that the conference was by and for developers; thus, Knowit Developer.

The word "Summit" was added quite undramatically; its use may have been inspired by the "Colorado Software Summit". The target group for the conference was the passionate system developers from Knowit, especially within the Java- and .NET-platforms. The goal was that as many of the participants as possible would also be speakers—preferably all. With this arrangement, it also became clear that no external speakers would be invited.
